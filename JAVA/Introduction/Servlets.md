- A servlet is small program that executes on the server.
- Servlets are used to create dynamically generated content that is then served to the client.
- Eg. An online store might use a servlet to loop up the price for an iten in a database. The price information is then used to dynamically generate a web page that is sent to the browser.
- Although dynamically generated content was available through mechanisms such as CGI (Common Gateway Interface), the servlet offered several advantages, including increased performance.
