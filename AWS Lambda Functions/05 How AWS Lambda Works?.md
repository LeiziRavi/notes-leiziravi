### Building Blocks

-   **Lambda function**: Whatever custom codes and libraries that we create are called a **function.**
-   **Event source**: Any AWS or custom service that triggers our function and helps in executing its logic
-   **Log streams**: Lambda monitors our function automatically and one can view its metric on CloudWatch, directly, but we can also code our function in a way that it provides us custom logging statements to let us analyze the flow of execution and performance of our function to check if it’s working properly.
