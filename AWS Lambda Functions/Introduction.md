- AWS lambda is a serverless computing service provided by Amazon to reduce the configuration of the servers, OS, Scalability, etc. 
- AWS lambda is capable of executing code on AWS Cloud.
- It runs in response to events on different AWS resources, which triggers AWS lambda functions.
- Pricing is pay-as-you-go which means we won't shell our money on idle lambda functions.
