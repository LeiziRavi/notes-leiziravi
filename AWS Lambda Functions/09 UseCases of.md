### Serverless Websites
Building a serverless website allows us to focus on our website code. This way, we don’t have to manage and operate its infrastructure. Sounds cool, isn’t it? Yes. This is the most common and interesting use case of AWS Lambda, where we are actually taking advantage of its pricing model. Hosting our static website over S3 and then making it available using AWS Lambda makes it easier for us to keep track of our resources being used and to understand if our code is feasible or not, all these we get with the ability to troubleshoot and fix any problem in no time.

### Automated Backups of Everyday Tasks
We can easily schedule Lambda events and create backups in our AWS accounts. Creating backups, checking if there are any idle resources, generating reports, and other tasks can be implemented by Lambda in no time.

### Filtering and Transforming Data
We can easily transfer data between Lambda and other Amazon Services, such as S3, Kinesis, [Amazon Redshift](https://intellipaat.com/blog/what-is-amazon-redshift-in-aws/), and other database services, along with the filtering of the data. We can easily transform and load data between Lambda and these services. When we investigate its industrial use cases, a very apt implementation of Lambda can be found in a company named **Localytics.**
