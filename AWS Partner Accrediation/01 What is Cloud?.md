- In a On-Premises IT environment, all the physical environment required for running businesses were owed, operated and maintained in-house by the company.
- A User was required to log-in to the corporate network to access resources that way.
- This would include corporate applications, file sharing, storage etc. 

 - __THE CLOUD__ provides access to the same or similar resources through internet as hosted by cloud services platform.


#### What is Cloud computing?
- Cloud computing is __on-demand delivery__ of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the Internet with __pay-as-you-go pricing__.
- Cloud computing platforms such amwazon web services owns and maintains the network connected hardware required for these application services.
- While customer provision and use what they need by a web application.


#### Benefits of cloud computing?
- Agility: 
	- Cloud provide easy access to a braod range of technologies, so organisations can innovate faster and run nearly anything they can imagine.
	- Oraganisations can spin-up resources as they need them, from infrastructure services such as compute, storage, databases to IoT, ML, data lakes and analytics and much more.
	- The organisation can deploy technologi services in a matter of minutes and get from an idea of implementation much faster than before. 
	- This allows an organisation the freedom to  experiment, test new ideas to customer expeirences and transform their business.
- Elasticity
	- With cloud services there is no need to over-provision resources upfront to handle peak-levels of business activity upfront in the future.
	- Instead resources can be provisioned with the amount of resources that are actually needed. 
	- The resources can thn be scaled up and down to instantly grow and shrink capacity as business needs change.
	- Cost Savings
		- Cloud allows an organisation to trade capital expenses such as such as data centers and physical servers for variable expences and only pay for IT, when they consume it.
		- Plus the variable expences are much lower due to economies of scale. 
- Deploy globally in minutes
	- With the cloud organisations can expand to new geographic regions and deploy globally in minutes. 
	- For example AWS has infrastructure all over the world. so deploying an application in multiple physical localtions can be done in a matter of few clicks.
	- Putting applications in close proximity to end-user reduces latency, and  improves their experience.
