AWS users can create and manage resources on the platform in three ways. All three options are built on a common, REST-like application programming interface (API) that serves as the foundation of AWS.

1. The AWS Management Console provides a rich graphical interface to a majority of the features offered by AWS. It facilitates cloud management for all aspects of a customerâ€™s AWS account, including monitoring their monthly spending by service, managing security credentials, or even setting up new IAM users.

2. The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) provides a suite of utilities that can be launched from a command program in Linux, Mac, or Windows. The CLI is an open source tool that provides commands for interacting with AWS services.

3. AWS Software Development Kits (SDKs) are packages that give access to AWS in a variety of popular programming languages. AWS manages infrastructure as code, by using the SDKs and the APIs that underlie them. These language-specific SDKs contain APIs with which customers can incorporate the wide range of AWS Cloud services into their code without writing the functions themselves.
