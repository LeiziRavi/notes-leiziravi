- There are five fundamental Snowflake Data Cloud features enabling Snowflake to be so disruptive and fundamentally different from previous database solutions: 
	1. The separation of compute from storage 
		- architectural decision to separate compute from storage 
		- pay-as-you-go RDBMS data service.
		- Any customer of Snowflake in the world could bring massive compute to any data problem for a few seconds or minutes at a reasonable cost vs. spending months negotiating and installing the standard RDBMS big data solutions.
		- __Cloud Backed Availability__: 
			- this enabled a distributed architecture of availability across availability zones and removed the immediate need of all previous on-prem solutions for backup.
			- This architecture also enabled time travel and cloning features, which were revolutionary concepts to bring to an RDBMS.
		- Cloud Enabled Scale:
			- Snowflakeâ€™s architecture created a solution that can share data without making copies.

	1. Automated data maintenance and scaling 
	2. Ease of use 
	3. Speed. Speed. And more speed
	4. Data sharing
