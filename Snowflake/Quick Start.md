__Note:__ 
- Each and every account is in a specific cloud provider and region. 
- Currently, you can only move data between different regions. 
- Shares only can be made within a specific region. When you design your architecture, make sure to take this into account that if you want to easily share data throughout an organization, you would want to create accounts in the same region. If you do not, then you will need to replicate data to the other region, and there will be some replication cloud service costs for this.
