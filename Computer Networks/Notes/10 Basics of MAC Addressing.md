#### MAC addressing
- MAC stands for Media Access Control
- Every node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC address
- ==IP Address = Location of a person==
- ==MAC Address = Name of the person==
- Routers need IP address but switches need MAC address

Mac Address:
- Every Node in the LAN is identified with the help of MAC Address
- Physical address or Hardware Address
- Unique
- Cannot be changed
- Assigned by the manufacturer
- Represented in hexadecimal
- Example: 70-20-84-00-ED-FC (48 bits)
- Separator: hyphen(-), period(.), and colon(:)


#### IP Addess VS MAC Address

| IP Address                              | MAC Address                              |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Needed for communication                | Needed for communication                 |
| 32 bits                                 | 48 bits                                  |
| Represented in Decimal                  | Represented in Hexadecimal               |
| Router needs IP Address to forward data | Switch needs MAC address to forward data |
| Example: 10.10.23.56                    | Example: 70-20-84-00-ED-FC                                         |
