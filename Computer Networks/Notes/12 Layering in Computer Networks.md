#### Layering:
- Layering means decomposing the problem into more manageable components (Layers)
- Advanatges:
	- It provides more modular design
	- Easy to troubleshoot


#### Protocols:
- It is a set of rules that governs data communication
- The protocols in each layer governs the activities of the data communication.


#### Layered Architecture:
1. The OSI Reference model
	- OSI stands for Open system Interconnection
	- It is model for understanding and desgining a network architecture that is flexible, robust and interoperable
	- Developed by the International Standards for Organisation.
	- The OSI model is not a protocol
	- It is a guideline and hence it is referred as OSI refernce model.
	- The purpose of the OSI model is to show how to facilitate communication between different systems without requiring changes to the logic of the underlying hardware and software.
	- The OSI model was never fully implemented
2. The TCP/IP Model
	- TCP/IP : Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
	- The TCP/IP protocol suite was developed prior to the OSI model
	- Therefore, the layers in the TCP/IP protocol suite do not exactly match in the OSI model
	- TCP/IP is a hierarchical protocol made up of interactive modules, each of which provides a specific functionality.
